/**
 * Safe back-end decorator.
 *
 * <p>This decorator wraps another {@link Back} implementation and ensures
 * that any exceptions thrown during socket processing are silently caught
 * and ignored. This is particularly useful in production environments where
 * you want to prevent a single faulty request from crashing the entire
 * server or disrupting other concurrent requests.
 *
 * <p>The decorator catches all {@link Throwable} instances, including both
 * checked and unchecked exceptions, as well as errors. This provides maximum
 * protection at the cost of potentially hiding important error information.
 * Use this decorator when server stability is more important than debugging
 * individual request failures.
 *
 * <p>Common use cases:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Production servers that must stay running despite client errors</li>
 *   <li>Load testing scenarios where individual failures are expected</li>
 *   <li>Wrapper around other back-ends that might throw unexpected exceptions</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The class is immutable and thread-safe.
