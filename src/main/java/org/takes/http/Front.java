 * HTTP front-end.
 *
 * <p>A front-end is responsible for accepting incoming client connections
 * and managing the overall server lifecycle. It typically binds to a network
 * port, listens for incoming TCP connections, and passes each connection
 * to a {@link Back} implementation for processing.
 *
 * <p>The front-end runs in a continuous loop, accepting connections until
 * the provided {@link Exit} condition indicates that the server should
 * shut down gracefully. This design allows for controlled server shutdown
 * and proper resource cleanup.
 *
 * <p>Key responsibilities:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Bind to network interface and port</li>
 *   <li>Accept incoming TCP connections</li>
 *   <li>Dispatch connections to back-end processors</li>
 *   <li>Monitor exit conditions for graceful shutdown</li>
 *   <li>Clean up network resources on termination</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>All implementations of this interface must be thread-safe.
